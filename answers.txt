1. I called the API endpoint "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.memberOf?\$select=displayName,id" and 
    got the code "BadRequest" which corresponds with HTTP status code 400. This tells me that the url
    I selected as the API endpoint likely doesn't exist since it was a BadRequest. The error message says
    'Invalid version' which corroborates the idea that the API endpoint called does not exist.
2. The error was caused because the API version v1.memberOf does not exist. The / to separate
    the version from the rest of the endpoint call was missing. The endpoint called was also missing
    the rest of the version. It should be .com/v1.0 and then also needs /me/memberOf to reach an actual
    existing endpoint. Since the version did not exist, and an additional parameter was missing, the error
    can be fixed by calling an existing version and including the full path to an existing API endpoint. 
3. https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/memberOf?\$select=displayName,id
    - base URL: https://graph.microsoft.com
    - version: v1.0
    - resource path: me/memberOf
    - query parameters: displayName and id (only asks for the display name and id of the objects at the endpoint)
4. Using the azure CLI and Microsoft Graph API directly relates to the AZ‑104 “Manage Azure identities and governance” exam domain.
    By learning what information can be retrieved in what ways, and about which individual(s) is key
    to being able to govern said individuals. Both the CLI and the API offer robust options for
    gathering different information unique to each identity queried. This allows for automating
    granting permissions and adding to/removing from groups using scripts and checks as demonstrated in
    parts B and C of this assignment. Scripts can be used to automatically check what groups a user is in,
    include rules to check if they should be/need to be in the groups they are in, and also add checks to 
    see if they are not in groups they need to be in, and then automatically remove or add them from the
    respective groups.
